# Code Adapted from

In order to complete this project, I used these three links to help build my website: https://github.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/blob/main/exercises/website-hosting/exercise.md, https://github.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/blob/main/exercises/website-structure/exercise.md, and https://github.com/prof-rossetti/internet-technologies/blob/main/exercises/website-style/exercise.md. Additionally, I found pieces of code from https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp, specifically for changing the font and adding text style, as well as implementing images and links to the website. 
## Installation

Fork this repo to make a copy under your own control, then clone your forked copy (for example, downloading it onto your Desktop). Locate the directory you downloaded, and open it with your file finder.

## Usage

To view the website, you can either use the file-open approach, or run a local webserver.

### File Open Approach

For the file open approach: right click on the "index.html" file and click "Open in browser", where you can view the file in the browser at its specified local filepath.

### Local Webserver Approach

For the local webserver approach: ensure you have access to Python (e.g. through the "base" Anaconda environment), navigate to the repository's root directory, and then run a local Python web server on a port like 8000:

```sh
# navigate to the repository's root directory, if necessary:
cd ~/Desktop/student-site

# run a local web server with Python 3.x (like in the Anaconda base environment):
python -m http.server 8000
```
